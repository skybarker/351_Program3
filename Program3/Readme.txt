To install the project, follow these steps:

1) Create a blank "3D URP" project in Unity Hub.  
   Note: Your project MUST use the Universal 
   Rendering Pipeline for textures and effects
   to render properly.
2) Allow the Unity editor to initialize the project.
3) Save your blank 3D URP project and exit Unity.
4) Navigate to project directory in file system.
5) Drop the "Assets" and "Project Settings" folders 
   into this directory.
6) Open and reload the Unity project you created.
7) In the project navigator, go to the assets directory
   and find the "Scenes" folder.
8) Click on the "WesternTown" to load it.
7) Go to Unity->File->Build Settings and verify that
   the "Cross-Country Scene" is in the "Scenes in Build" 
   list.
8) If the scene is not in the build list, click
   "Add Open Scenes". The scene should appear checked. 
9) The game template then should be ready for building 
   and running.
